# Fordham-Autograder-projecct

## Features

- Data structure Labs, with corrected and intended error code for the system.
- C++ code for the palindrome and the labrational code.
- [palindrome CPP](https://github.com/winsor-tse/Fordham-Autograder-projecct/blob/main/palindrone/Palindrome.cpp)
- [Labrational CPP](https://github.com/winsor-tse/Fordham-Autograder-projecct/blob/main/rationallab/Labrational_2.cpp)
- Basic python math functions for testing
- Provides or imitates student's code and common mistakes that can occur.
- Runs on the current Fordham Autograder system.
- Includes .in and .correct files, which emulate input files(.in) and output matching(.correc)

## .in and .correct files and its feature
  ### eaxmple .in files
  [.in file for palindrome](https://github.com/winsor-tse/Fordham-Autograder-projecct/blob/main/palindrone/palindronetest1.in)
  > A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.
  > Be at a time I emit a beat
  > Racecar
  > A lad named E. Mandala
  > A Toyota's a Toyota
  > Race and tell a dancer
  
  The .in file is used to test the functionality of the system. It serves as the input of a user and introduces a better way for professors to implement and run test cases.
  
  ### example .correct files
  [.correct file for palindrome](https://github.com/winsor-tse/Fordham-Autograder-projecct/blob/main/palindrone/palindronetest1.correct)
  Matches output of the code to the text.
  
## Unit testing code and its outputs
  ###Sample error or syntax error
  [Sample error for system](https://github.com/winsor-tse/Fordham-Autograder-projecct/blob/main/rationallab/error%201.PNG)
  This error provides many level of feedback to either the professor or the student
  Information can be hidden or toggled using the autograder system.
  Many errors can occur, but with this particular error, the professor can deduct certain amounts of points based on the error.
