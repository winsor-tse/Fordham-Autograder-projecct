## .in and .correct files and its feature
  [.in file for palindrome](https://github.com/winsor-tse/Fordham-Autograder-projecct/blob/main/palindrone/palindronetest1.in)
  > A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.
  > Be at a time I emit a beat
  > Racecar
  > A lad named E. Mandala
  > A Toyota's a Toyota
  > Race and tell a dancer
  The .in file is used to test the functionality of the system. It serves as the input of a user and introduces a better way for professors to implement and run test cases.
